# C# Lab Files

**Make sure you have Update 3 of Visual Studio 2015, and the tooling at https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows.**

- Open the solution
- Right-click on BlackjackTest and "Restore Packages"
- At the Package Manager Console, type: `dotnet restore`
- Go to the Test Explorer, and "Run All" tests
- If VS Says you have the wrong version, you MIGHT need to click on "download it", and then fix your global.json 
  file to match what it says what it wants you to have.
    - The command to find out what version you *have* is: `dotnet -version`
